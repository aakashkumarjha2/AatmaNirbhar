/*
Given two singly linked lists of size N and M, write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.

Y ShapedLinked List
Above diagram shows an example with two linked list having 15 as intersection point.
Note: Expected time complexity is O(m + n) where m and n are lengths of two linked lists.

Input:
First line of input is the number of test cases T. Every test case has four lines. First line of every test case contains three numbers, x (number of nodes before merge point in 1st list), y (number of nodes before merge point in 2nd list) and z (number of nodes after merge point). Next three lines contain x, y and z values.

Output:
Print the data of the node in the linked list where two linked lists intersects.

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function intersetPoint() which finds the point of intersection of two linked list. The function should return data value of a node where two linked lists merge. If linked list do not merge at any point, then it should return -1.

Challenge : Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N+M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= value <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
2 3 2
10 20
30 40 50
5 10
2 3 2
10 20
30 40 50
10 20
Output:
5
10

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The point of intersection of two linked list is 5, means both of them get linked (intersects) with each other at node whose value is 5.
Testcase 2: The point of intersection of two linked list is 10. Hence, output is 10.
